    <h2>Propose</h2>

    <p>This studio has broadened my perspective on what design can be. I now see value in slower, more intuitive data collection, and I’m interested in continuing to work with personal, physical, and emotional data, not just through visuals, but also interaction and narrative.</p>

    <p>Moving forward, I want to explore how this kind of data storytelling can be integrated into UX/UI or interactive web projects, possibly by combining analog elements like cyanotype with JavaScript-based visualisation, motion design, or sound. As argued by designer and researcher Giorgia Lupi, we need to treat data not as cold numbers, but as “a snapshot of human life” (1.4, Lupi, 2017). This aligns with my desire to design interfaces that communicate not just information, but feeling.</p>

    <p>The process of transforming physical traces of time into a digital story reminded me that design is not only about clarity, it can also be about evoking emotion. Experience Design scholar Marc Hassenzahl writes that “experience is not a property of a product but an emergent outcome of interaction” (1.5, Hassenzahl, 2010), which inspires me to consider how my future projects can become spaces for meaning making.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, this studio reminded me that data is not neutral, it’s deeply human. And as designers, we can choose to honour that complexity.</p>
