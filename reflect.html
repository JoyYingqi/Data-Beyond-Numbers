    <h3>1. Exhibition</h3>
    <p>I worked in the Coordination group throughout the exhibition, from preparation to set-up to the end. This experience gave me insight into the logistics and communication behind collaborative creative projects. Our team was responsible for communicating with different groups, keeping them updated, and managing timelines. I created a Gantt chart to support project planning, though it wasn’t fully adopted despite follow ups with other teams. This challenge revealed a key learning for me: creating a tool doesn’t guarantee engagement, we need to address the reasons behind disengagement.</p>

    <p>I was also the main contact for the Promotions team, regularly checking in, sharing updates, and offering support. For example, when Melbourne Design Week announced details on social media promotion, I created and shared a table with timelines, post suggestions, and asset links.</p>

    <p>Beyond coordination, I also followed up on missing poster submissions, supported logistics on set up day, helped run through the launch event plan with the Launch team, and worked as a photographer for the opening night.</p>

    <p>The exhibition reminded me that coordination is both about structure and adaptability. Although there were gaps in engagement with tools like the Gantt chart, we still managed to support each other. It was an important reminder that soft collaboration skills are just as crucial as planning assets.</p>

    <h3>2. Intensive Week</h3>
    <p>The intensive week with students from Vietnam and Barcelona was a turning point in this studio. It expanded my understanding of how data relates to design. Our group theme, “time,” is not just scientific or mechanical—it can also be a cultural and relational construct. Our final group piece showed different experiments with time, like natural rhythms, sound, and ink. It also made us reflect on the question: “Can we trust time?”</p>

    <p>This experience opened up new ways of thinking and became the conceptual foundation for my individual project. It also highlighted the power of hybrid collaboration, where different worldviews and creative methods intersect to generate something unexpected.</p>

    <h3>3. Individual Work</h3>
    <p>My individual work for the exhibition is “Can You Touch the Time”, which extended the concept from our group theme. I used cyanotype, a historical photographic printing process that produces blue-toned images using natural light. Developed in the 1840s by Sir John Herschel, cyanotype was later popularised by botanist Anna Atkins to document algae and plant specimens. It is known for its simplicity, tactility, and dependence on sunlight, making it a poetic medium for working with natural data and time (1.3, Alternative Photography, 2024).</p>

    <p>In this project, I placed a crystal object on cyanotype paper and exposed it to sunlight every 30 minutes over two days. The resulting prints recorded the shifting shadows as visual traces of time passing. Working with cyanotype meant embracing variables like light intensity, weather, and timing.</p>

    <p>Initially, I planned to exhibit the physical prints, but due to exhibition constraints, I adapted the work into a digital video piece that includes someone trying to touch the cyanotype which reflecting my theme: “touch the time.” This shift pushed me to reframe the work’s impact, not as static artefacts but as a time-based experience.</p>

    <p>Through this, I learned that working with data can be intuitive, open-ended, and emotionally resonant. Cyanotype became a material metaphor for time—fleeting, unpredictable, and always in motion. This moment was significant, and it reminded me that constraints can open up new creative pathways.</p>

    <p>Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of how data is shaped by the way we collect, present, and interpret it. I also appreciated the balance between control and unpredictability, especially with natural processes like cyanotype, where sunlight and timing are variable. These moments taught me to design with the materials and context, not just for a fixed outcome.</p>
