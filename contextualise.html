    <p><strong>Contextualise</strong></p>
    <p>This year’s Common Design Studio subject is “Data – Beyond Numbers”. During my time studying in this studio, I explored how data can be transformed into formats beyond numbers, such as emotional or sensory experiences. Our collaborative intensive week with students from Vietnam and Barcelona centred around the theme of “Time”, and we investigated diverse understandings: linear, cyclical, social, personal, and environmental.</p>

    <p>This approach reflects broader movements in critical data visualisation and speculative design, where the goal isn’t just to present data, but to evoke reflection or provoke questions, like for our team: “Can we trust time?”</p>

    <p>Inspired by this, I began to view time not only as a unit to measure, but as something we feel, notice, and live through. This shift had direct implications for my own design practice. It encouraged me to think beyond digital dashboards or charts, and explore more tactile and emotional methods of representing data.</p>

    <p>Olafur Eliasson is an artist/designer who creates large-scale installations about time, light, perception, and nature. His immersive installations, like <em>Your Uncertain Shadow</em> and <em>The Weather Project</em>, use light, space, and environment to shift perception and deepen awareness, which significantly influenced my thinking. As Eliasson notes, his works aim to “people to become aware of how they perceive the world” (1.1, Eliasson, 2023).</p>

    <p>I was also inspired by designer Stefanie Posavec, who often works with data in a hand-drawn, organic way. Her work often “visualises the invisible” (1.2, Posavec, 2024), reminding me that slowness and intimacy are valid modes of engaging with data.</p>

    <p>These inspirations informed my individual work and also shaped my contributions to the “Data – Beyond Numbers” exhibition.</p>
